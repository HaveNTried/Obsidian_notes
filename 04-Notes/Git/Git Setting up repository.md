# Git Setting up repository

The high level points this guide will cover are:

- [[git init|Initializing a new Git repo]]
- [[git clone|Cloning an existing Git repo]]
- Committing a modified version of a file to the repo
- Configuring a Git repo for remote collaboration
- Common Git version control commands

By the end of this module, you should be able to create a Git repo, use common Git commands, commit a modified file, view your projectâ€™s history and configure a connection to a Git hosting service (Bitbucket).
