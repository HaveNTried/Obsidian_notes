# GNU Linux

Since the 1990s, there has been ongoing debate over whether [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems "Operating systems") that use the [[Linux Kernel]] in combination with [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU "GNU") software should be referred to as _Linux_ or [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy#cite_note-Noyes_20122-1)

Supporters of the term _Linux_ argue that it is more widely used in the media and by the general public and that it serves as a practical shorthand for systems that combine the Linux kernel with software from a variety of sources, including the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project "GNU Project").
