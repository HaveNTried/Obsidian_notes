### Invisible Unicode characters?

In Unicode there are a lot of invisible, non-printable characters: regular white-space characters (e.g. [U+0020 SPACE](https://invisible-characters.com/0020-SPACE.html "Information about U+0020 SPACE")), language specific fillers (e.g. [U+3164 HANGUL FILLER](https://invisible-characters.com/3164-HANGUL-FILLER.html "Information about U+3164 HANGUL FILLER") of the Korean Hangual alphabet), or special characters (e.g. [U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK](https://invisible-characters.com/2800-BRAILLE-PATTERN-BLANK.html "Information about U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK")). While all of these have a specific meaning in their natural context, they can be used in various applications that don't allow for regular ==whitespace== characters.

### Unusual Applications

While the popular game [Among Us](https://www.epicgames.com/store/de/p/among-us) doesn't allow for an empty player name, or a name just containing regular space characters, you can copy and paste the [U+3164 HANGUL FILLER](https://invisible-characters.com/3164-HANGUL-FILLER.html) when naming your player.
[Send empty Whatsapp messages (instructions)](https://invisible-characters.com/empty-whatsapp.html) using the [U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK](https://invisible-characters.com/200E-LEFT-TO-RIGHT-MARK.html "Information about U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK").
When copy and pasting the [U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER](https://invisible-characters.com/200C-ZERO-WIDTH-NON-JOINER.html "Information about U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER") into the title field of a Youtube video, the title becomes empty.
[Send empty tweets (instructions)](https://invisible-characters.com/empty-tweet.html) using the [U+3164 HANGUL FILLER](https://invisible-characters.com/3164-HANGUL-FILLER.html "Information about U+3164 HANGUL FILLER").
You can have an [invisible TikTok nickname (instructions!)](https://invisible-characters.com/invisible-tiktok-name.html) by using the [U+FFFC OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER](https://invisible-characters.com/FFFC-OBJECT-REPLACEMENT-CHARACTER.html "Information about U+FFFC OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER") character.
[Send an empty Instagram comment (instructions)](https://invisible-characters.com/empty-instagram-comment.html) using the [U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE](https://invisible-characters.com/200B-ZERO-WIDTH-SPACE.html "Information about U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE").
