***DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to unite people,in application planning, development, delivery, and operations. DevOps enables coordination and collaboration between formerly siloed roles like development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security.***

### roadmap

Before diving into specific tools, you need a strong technical base. These skills are the bedrock of a DevOps career.

- **Operating Systems**: Most DevOps work is done on **Linux**. You'll need to be proficient with the command line (CLI) using tools like Bash or Zsh. This includes navigating the file system, managing users and permissions, and using essential commands.
- **Programming and Scripting**: Proficiency in a scripting language is crucial for automation. **Python** remains the most popular choice, but languages like Bash and Go are also widely used.
- **Networking**: A solid understanding of networking concepts is vital for managing infrastructure and troubleshooting connectivity issues. Key topics include TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, firewalls, and load balancing.
- **Version Control**: **Git** is the industry standard for source code management (SCM). You must be an expert in using Git for branching, merging, and collaborating. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are where you'll host and manage your repositories.

### ⚙️ Core DevOps Practices & Tools

This section covers the central concepts of DevOps and the tools that enable them.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: IaC automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure. Instead of manually setting up servers, you define your infrastructure in code.
	**Tools**: **Terraform** is the industry standard for provisioning multi-cloud infrastructure, while **Ansible** is widely used for configuration management and application deployment.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Containers package applications and their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across different environments.
    - **Tools**: **Docker** is the primary tool for building and managing individual containers. For large-scale, automated management of containers, **Kubernetes (K8s)** is the king of orchestration. You should also learn how to use **Helm** for packaging and deploying applications on Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)**: This is the backbone of the DevOps pipeline. CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code.
    - **Tools**: Popular CI/CD platforms include **GitLab CI/CD**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Jenkins**. **ArgoCD** is an excellent choice for implementing GitOps, a practice that uses Git as the single source of truth for all deployments.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Once applications are deployed, you need to monitor their performance and health. Observability provides deep insights into why a system is behaving a certain way.
    - **Tools**: **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for creating dashboards are a standard combination. For centralized logging, the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Fluentd** is commonly used.

### ☁️ Cloud Platforms & Advanced Topics

DevOps is deeply intertwined with cloud computing. Understanding at least one major cloud provider is essential.

- **Cloud Providers**: You should aim to master one cloud platform while being familiar with others.

    - **AWS** (Amazon Web Services): The market leader. Learn services like EC2, S3, IAM, and Lambda.
        
    - **Azure**: Popular among enterprises, with services like Azure DevOps, AKS, and Functions.
        
    - **GCP** (Google Cloud Platform): Growing fast, especially for data and AI workloads. Focus on GKE, Cloud Run, and Cloud Build.
        
- **DevSecOps**: Security must be integrated into every stage of the DevOps lifecycle. This "shift-left" approach ensures vulnerabilities are caught early.
    
    - **Practices**: Learn about secrets management using tools like **HashiCorp Vault**, and container security with scanners like **Trivy** or **Aqua Security**.
        
- **AIOps & Automation**: AI is increasingly being used to enhance DevOps.
    
    - **Trends**: AIOps platforms use AI for intelligent monitoring and anomaly detection. AI assistants like GitHub Copilot can automate code and configuration generation, and self-healing systems can automatically remediate issues.
